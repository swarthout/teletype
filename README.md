Hello all,
This is a project of mine that started when I read the book "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" by Jonathan Foer.
In the book, there is a section where the grandfather sends a message through the telephone by using the alphanumeric keys on the phone dialer.
I am working on replicating this process by creating python programs that will encode and decode secret messages by this method.
I am just doing this for fun and for programming practice and I don't have any intention to market this program. It is just designed to be a fun way to send secret messages.
Note - I am developing this program with the PyCharm IDE and therefore I recommend you use it to edit the code. I included all of the necessary files and directories to use this program. 
In order for the code to run properly on your machine, you must change the file paths for the two word lists.
Enjoy!
